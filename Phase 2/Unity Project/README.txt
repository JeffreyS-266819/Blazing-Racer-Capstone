Zip files of Unity Project exceed GitHub's 100MB file limit. If we were to upload one to the repository it would prevent us from being able to uploaded anything else. For now we will upload everything else we can here. For an example of what we would: the scripts, the models, textures, materials, prefabs, and anything else possible. In addition to those we will upload screenshot and recording for each version for additional proof.
